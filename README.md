### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

``I am proud of being able to center this css element in the middle of the screen, but I'm sure there are easier ways of doing this. ``

.QR_background {
    background-color: white;
    position: fixed;
    top: 25%;
    left: 50%;
    margin-top: -50px;
    margin-left: -180px;
    width: 330px;
    height: 500px;
    border-radius: 5%;
}


### Continued development

In the future, I want to focus on getting more accustomed to using style elements.
